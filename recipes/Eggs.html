  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      2–4 large eggs

    <li>
      2 tablespoons milk (optional, for extra fluffiness)

      Salt, to taste
    </li>
    <li>
      Pepper, to taste

      1 teaspoon butter or oil for cooking
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <li>Beat the eggs: In a bowl, whisk the eggs with milk (if using), salt, and pepper until fully combined.</li>
    <li>Heat the pan: Place a non-stick skillet over medium heat and melt the butter or heat the oil.</li>

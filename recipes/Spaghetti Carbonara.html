  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      200g (7 oz) spaghetti
    </li>
    <li>
      100g (3.5 oz) pancetta or bacon, diced
    </li>
    <li>
      2 large eggs
    </li>
    <li>
      ½ cup grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese
    </li>
    <li>
      2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
    </li>
    <li>
      Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
    </li>
    <li>
      A small handful of chopped parsley (optional, for garnish)
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Cook the pasta: Boil spaghetti in salted water according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve ½ cup of pasta water before draining.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cook the pancetta/bacon: In a skillet over medium heat, cook the diced pancetta or bacon until crispy. If using garlic, add it in the last minute of cooking.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mix eggs and cheese: In a bowl, whisk together eggs and grated cheese until smooth.
    </li>
    <li>
      Combine everything: Add the drained pasta to the skillet with pancetta. Remove from heat, then quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture, tossing rapidly to coat the pasta. Add a little reserved pasta water if it seems dry.
    </li>
    <li>
      Season and serve: Season with salt and plenty of black pepper. Garnish with parsley and extra cheese if desired. Serve immediately.

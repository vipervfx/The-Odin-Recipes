  <h1>Pizza Recipe</h1>

  <Img src="Pictures/pizza.jpg"></Img>

  <p>Pizza is one of the most popular and versatile foods in the world. It starts with a simple base of dough that’s topped with rich tomato sauce, melted cheese, and any number of toppings, from classic pepperoni to fresh vegetables. The combination of a crisp crust, gooey cheese, and flavorful toppings makes it a comfort food favorite.
    Homemade pizza is especially rewarding because you can customize it to your taste. Whether you like thin and crunchy or thick and fluffy crust, a light layer of toppings or a fully loaded pie, pizza is all about creating something delicious that brings people together.

    </li>
    <li>
      2 tablespoons olive oil
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Toppings (Personal Preference)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      ½ cup pizza sauce (tomato-based)
    </li>
    <li>

    <li>
      Prepare the dough:
      <ul>
        <li>
          In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix until it forms a dough.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Knead the dough:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Let it rise:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1–2 hours, or until it doubles in size.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven:
        <ul>
          Set your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it inside to heat up.
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the dough:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Punch down the risen dough and roll it out into your desired pizza shape and thickness on a floured surface.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer it to a greased baking sheet or preheated pizza stone.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add toppings:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sprinkle shredded mozzarella evenly over the sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add any other toppings you like (pepperoni, veggies, herbs).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the pizza:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 12–15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Let the pizza cool for a couple of minutes before slicing. Enjoy hot!

  <h1>Pizza Recipe</h1>

  <Img src="Pictures/pizza.jpg"></Img>

  <p>Pizza is one of the most popular and versatile foods in the world. It starts with a simple base of dough that’s topped with rich tomato sauce, melted cheese, and any number of toppings, from classic pepperoni to fresh vegetables. The combination of a crisp crust, gooey cheese, and flavorful toppings makes it a comfort food favorite.
    Homemade pizza is especially rewarding because you can customize it to your taste. Whether you like thin and crunchy or thick and fluffy crust, a light layer of toppings or a fully loaded pie, pizza is all about creating something delicious that brings people together.
